            <h2>Coding is Love</h2>
            <p>This project aims to develop an innovative system for generating electricity using speed breakers. 
              The system will harness the kinetic energy of moving vehicles as they pass over speed breakers, 
              and convert it into electrical energy. The system will be designed for use in urban and rural areas 
              with high traffic volume, and can potentially reduce dependence on traditional sources of electricity.</p>
